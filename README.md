# Café

## Overview
Welcome to Café, a versatile and efficient mathematical tool designed for students, engineers, and enthusiasts who need more than just a basic calculator. This project aims to combine the simplicity of traditional calculators with the advanced features of softwares like MATLAB & Desmos, providing a comprehensive solution for various mathematical tasks.

## Motivation
This project was born out of a need for a more integrated and efficient tool during high-pressure situations, like exams, where quick calculations and unit tracking are essential. Traditional calculators and even some advanced software fall short in providing a seamless experience for managing complex calculations, units, and data.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform standard calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
- **Variable Creation**: Quickly define variables (e.g., `n = 5`, `nBr = 16e-5`).
- **Linear Algebra**: Handle matrices and vectors effortlessly.
- **Unit Handling**: Automatic unit checking and conversions with simple syntax (e.g., `distance = 14 meters`, `mass = 72 kg`).
- **LaTeX Rendering**: Display equations and calculations in a clean, readable format with LaTeX.
- **Built-in Constants**: Access geometric and physical constants without the need for re-declaration (e.g., `pi`, `e`, `k_b`).
- **Object and Namespace Management**: Organize data using object-like structures (e.g., `Hf.mu = 14 V`, `Pb.mu = 15*pi V`).
- **Analytical Calculus**: Perform symbolic integration and differentiation.

## Alternatives and Why They Fall Short
While software like Desmos, MATLAB, and Mathematica offer powerful features, they often lack the specific combination of simplicity, unit management, and integration that this project aims to provide. Our goal is to create a tool that is not only powerful but also user-friendly and complete.

## Implementation
This project is implemented in Swift, a language known for its excellent design and performance. The choice of Swift ensures that the software is both efficient and easy to develop, with a focus on delivering a high-quality user experience.

## Future Plans
We aim to continuously improve and expand the Calculator's features. Upcoming additions include:
- Enhanced graphical interface for better user interaction.
- More advanced calculus capabilities.
- Integration with other mathematical libraries.
